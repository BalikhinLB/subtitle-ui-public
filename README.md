# subtitle-ui
```
Vue.js is not in my skills, but it is simply. And i did my UI on it.
```
## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
You shoud setting maven-resources-plugin in the backend project to build *.jar with ui. 
npm run build
```
